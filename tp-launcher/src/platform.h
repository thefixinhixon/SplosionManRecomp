// launch plans, the UI) is written once, in plain Qt. The Windows
// branches are written but NOT compiled on this machine - there is
// no Windows kit here - so they are kept deliberately simple and
// obviously correct; Phase 2 (see WINDOWS.md) builds and verifies
// them. Linux behavior is unchanged by construction: the Linux
// branches are the code that used to live inline in gamedetect.cpp
// and launcher.cpp, moved, not rewritten.
